# Vehicle Data

**Vehicles** in _Unturned_ consist of the 6 different engine types, Car, Plane, Helicopter, Blimp, Boat, and Train. Many properties of the different engine types are shared between them, however, some are specific to each engine type, and are categorized as such below.

- [Non-specific Data](#Non-specific-Data)
  - [Battery Settings](#Battery-Settings)
- [Car](#Car)
- [Plane](#Plane)
- [Helicopter](#Helicopter)
- [Blimp](#Blimp)
- [Boat](#Boat)
- [Train](#Train)

## Non Specific data

---

__ID__: The item ID is used to spawn the item into the game, and is represented as an unsigned 16 bit integer (a range of 0â€“65535). It is recommended not to use a value less than 2,000 as those are reserved for official content. It is also recommended to avoid any ID range being used by curated content, as those are often used by modded servers and custom Workshop maps. Vehicles ID ranges do not conflict with those of Items or Objects.

__Bypass\_ID\_Limit__: Allows you to use an ID that is within the space reserved for vanilla content.

__Size2\_Z__: Controls orthagonal camera size for vehicle skin icons. Basically irrelevant since very few vehicles have skins.

__Shared_Skin_Name__:

Shared_Skin_Lookup_ID

__Engine__: `Car`, `Plane`, `Helicopter`, `Blimp`, `Boat`, `Train`. Defaults to Car.

__Rarity__: `Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`, `Mythical`. Defaults to common. 

__Zip__: Handlebar related property.

__Bicycle__: Tells unturned to use bycicle animations.

__Reclined__: Uses the slightly different drivers reclined animation.

__Crawler__: Locks wheel turning.

__LockMouse__: Locks the mouse to the forward position so the driver cannot move their view.

__Traction__: Changes the wheels physics on ice and offroad.

__Sleds__: Makes the wheels slide easier. For us on plane wheels where this effect is desired.

### Battery-Settings
